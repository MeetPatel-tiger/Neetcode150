# 📘 NeetCode 150 Journey

I decided to start documenting the LeetCode problems I solve.  
Back in high school, I practiced on **Codewars**, but writing down every single problem from there would take forever (metaphorically speaking), and nobody wants that, especially me.  

Last month, I began the **NeetCode 150** but struggled with consistency.  
Now, my goal is simple: **solve one problem a day** and, more importantly, focus on understanding the *why* behind each solution.  

💡 One thing I’ve learned from successful LinkedIn connections:  
> Truly understanding how and why a problem works is always more valuable than just solving a large number of problems.  

At first, I would just look at a solution, move on, and forget it a week later.  
This repo is my way of breaking that cycle by staying consistent, learning deeply, and building a personal reference library.

## 📂 Repo Structure

Each problem has its own subfolder with:

- ✅ **Solution Code** (written by me)  
- 📝 **Explanation** in my own words (breaking down *how/why* it works)  
- 🔑 **Notes & Insights** for future reference

## 🎯 Why this repo matters

This is not just about grinding problems, personally, it’s about **mastery, consistency, and reflection**.  
By the end of NeetCode 150, I’ll have a collection of solutions and explanations that showcase my problem-solving growth and serve as a resource I can always revisit. 
I may continue to add more Leetcode problems.
